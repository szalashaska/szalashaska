- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kamil Petryniak
##About me
I am self-taught quick learner looking forward to further develop new skills and gain more valuable experience as developer
After 6 years of experience in the field of Civil Engineering, where I was involved in design of various constructions, created detailed 3D BIM models and finally prepared documentation and drawings I decided that it is time for a change.

I was always interested in new technologies and computer science. I decided to give it a try and took Harvard's CS50 course. After a few courses, lots of tutorials and first commercial experience I know that it was the best decision I could made.

As a frontend developer my primary focus is on JavaScript and Python.

##Educational background
From 2011 to 2017 I was studying at Lodz University of Technology, faculty of Civil Engineering. As a result I obtained master's degree. For a semester between 2015/2016 I took part in "Erasmus" - students exchange program at Instituto Superior de Engenharia de Lisboa, Portugal.
In years 2021 and 2022 I participated and completed Harvard's CS50 courses.

- âš¡ Besides coding I like climbing, trekking, hiking, playing guitar and traveling.
