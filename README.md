# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Kamil Petryniak

## About me
I am self-taught quick learner looking forward to further develop new skills and gain more valuable experience as developer
After 6 years of experience in the field of Civil Engineering, where I was involved in design of various constructions, created detailed 3D BIM models and finally prepared documentation and drawings I decided that it is time for a change.

I was always interested in new technologies and computer science. I decided to give it a try and took Harvard's CS50 course. After a few courses, lots of tutorials and first commercial experience I know that it was the best decision I could made.

As a frontend developer my primary focus is on JavaScript and Python.
